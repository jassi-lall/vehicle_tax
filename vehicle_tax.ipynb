    "# Aim\n",
    "Given a numerplate output the amount of vehicle excise duty ('road tax') payable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "Purchased a 2012 car via autotrader that was advertised as £30 VED by the dealer and by autotrader themselves. Turns out the VED is £100. Autotrader don't guarantee the accuracy of data provided in their T&Cs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "Revenue from vehicle tax is added to the central funds of the exchequer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system for cars registered before 1 April 2017 will not change (according to government). For cars registered on 1 April 2017 onwards there is a simple system of £0 for cars with 0 emissions and a standard rate of £140 for non-zero emission vehicles. There is an additional charge £310 for 5 years for vehicles over £40,000 as well as a special first year rate for new cars that depends on emissions. Source: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vehicle-excise-duty/vehicle-excise-duty\n",
    "\n",
    "We are only interested in vehicles registered before 1 April 2017 due to the simplicity of the other system as mentioned above. Bare in mind the system is subject to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limitations\n",
    "For simplicity we will ignore the first year rate on post 2017 cars (which in most cases is close or lower than £140) and the (£310 additional charge for 5 years on cars over £40,0000). These may be added later but are not important for our use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pseudo Code\n",
    "1) Accept numberplate from user\n",
    "2) Submit form with given numberplate here: https://vehicleenquiry.service.gov.uk/?locale=en\n",
    "3) Ask user if given vehicle is correct.\n",
    "4) If vehicle is correct submit yes to website. If not try again.\n",
    "5) Extract CO2 emissions data and date of register from given information.\n",
    "6) Use the information to determine vehicle tax.\n",
    "7) Present vehicle tax to user along with any other relevant bonus data."
